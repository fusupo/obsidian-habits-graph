## Notes

This is an example daily note showing how to embed the habit graph using a code block.
Simply add a code block with the language identifier `habit-graph` and it will automatically
render all your habits in the same org-mode style as the sidebar view.

The graph will update automatically based on:
- Your habit tag setting (default: `#habit`)
- Days before/after today setting
- All habits found in your vault with recurring tasks
